# OT Sports Betting System

**Optimal Transport AI for Sports Gambling Edge Detection**

A production-grade system that uses Optimal Transport theory to detect arbitrage opportunities in sports betting markets by measuring the geometric distance between true probability distributions and market-implied distributions.

## 🧠 Theory: Why OT Beats the Market
### The Core Insight
Sportsbooks price expected values accurately, but they do **not** price distribution geometry accurately.

Optimal Transport measures the "cost" to morph one probability distribution into another using the Wasserstein distance:

$$W(P_{true}, P_{market}) = \min_\pi \int\int \|x - y\|^2 \, d\pi(x, y)$$

If \(W > \text{threshold}\) → Edge exists → Bet.

This is the same framework used in:

- Quant finance (volatility arbitrage)
- Machine learning (domain adaptation)
- Economics (income inequality measurement)

### Why Books Don't Use This
- Computational cost: OT is expensive
- Data requirements: Need causal models + simulations
- Liquidity constraints: Books balance action, not optimize distributions
- Public betting bias: Books shade lines toward public sentiment

You have a structural edge.

## 📐 Mathematical Framework
### 1. Wasserstein Distance (W₂)
$$W_2(\mu, \nu) = \inf \left\{ \int\int \|x - y\|^2 \, d\pi(x,y) : \pi \in \Pi(\mu, \nu) \right\}$$

Where:

- \(\mu\) = true distribution (from Monte Carlo + causal model)
- \(\nu\) = market distribution (from odds)
- \(\pi\) = transport plan (how to move probability mass)

Interpretation: If \(W_2\) is large, the market is geometrically far from truth.

### 2. Causal DAG
Model causal relationships:

- Injuries → Team Strength → Scoring
- Weather → Passing → Total Points
- Matchup → Pace → Distribution Variance

Books model correlations. You model causation.

### 3. Expected Value with OT Correction
\(\text{EV} = P(\text{true}) \times \text{Payout} - (1 - P(\text{true})) \times \text{Stake}\)

Recent update: the EV formula now correctly uses the true win probability against the stake (loss side) rather than market-implied vig, aligning calculations with real betting returns.

If \(W_2(P_{true}, P_{market}) > \delta:\)

\[\text{EV}_{adjusted} = \text{EV} \times (1 + \alpha \times W_2)\]

The OT distance amplifies confidence in EV calculation.

### 4. Kelly Criterion Bet Sizing
\[f^* = \frac{p \times b - q}{b}\]

Where:

- \(p\) = true win probability
- \(b\) = net odds (decimal - 1)
- \(q\) = 1 - p

Use fractional Kelly (0.5×) for risk control.

```

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   The repo ships with stubbed data sources, so no API keys are required to run the demo or tests.

2. **Run demo for a sport**
   ```bash
   python -m src.agent demo --sport basketball_nba --max-games 2
   ```
   The demo uses the synthetic odds generator in `src/data/odds_scraper.py` to create matchups from the team registry and prints any detected edges.

3. **Scan supported sports**
   ```bash
   # Scan every supported code
   python -m src.agent scan --sport all

   # Scan just one league
   python -m src.agent scan --sport football_nfl
   ```
   Scans enumerate teams from `team_registry.py`, generate odds, and report how many matchups were analyzed per league.

4. **Analyze a specific game in code**
   ```python
   from src.sports.nba import NBAAnalyzer

   analyzer = NBAAnalyzer()
   edge = analyzer.analyze_game(
       game_id="nba_001",
       home_team="Golden State Warriors",
       away_team="Memphis Grizzlies",
       total_line=215.5,
       over_odds=-110,
       under_odds=-110,
       injuries=[]
   )

   if edge:
       print(f"Bet {edge.recommendation} {edge.line}")
       print(f"EV: {edge.expected_value:.2%}")
       print(f"Kelly: {edge.kelly_fraction:.2%}")
   ```

## 🤖 Discord Bot
Bring the scanner directly into your Discord server with slash commands and tiered access:

1. Install dependencies and set environment variables
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   export DISCORD_TOKEN="your_bot_token"
   export DISCORD_GUILD_ID="optional_guild_id_for_faster_sync"  # optional
   export DISCORD_PREMIUM_ROLE="premium"  # role name that unlocks paid commands
   ```

2. Run the bot
   ```bash
   python src/discord_bot.py
   ```

3. Slash commands
   - `/scan` — **Free**: returns the top five edges across all supported sports.
   - `/scan_sport sport:<code>` — **Premium**: returns every edge with EV ≥ 4% for the chosen sport (NBA, NFL, NHL, FBS, CBB, soccer top-5 leagues, Champions League).

Members must have the configured premium role to access sport-specific scans; otherwise they only see the free-tier `/scan` output.

## 📊 Usage Examples
### Example 1: NBA game with a manual injury adjustment
```python
from src.sports.nba import NBAAnalyzer

analyzer = NBAAnalyzer()

edge = analyzer.analyze_game(
    game_id="nba_001",
    home_team="Golden State Warriors",
    away_team="Memphis Grizzlies",
    total_line=215.5,
    over_odds=-110,
    under_odds=-110,
    injuries=[{"player": "Steph Curry", "status": "out", "impact": -5.8}],
)

if edge:
    print(f"Bet {edge.recommendation} {edge.line}")
    print(f"EV: {edge.expected_value:.2%}")
    print(f"Kelly: {edge.kelly_fraction:.2%}")
```

### Example 2: Batch analysis using the synthetic odds generator
```python
from src.data.odds_scraper import OddsScraper
from src.sports.nba import NBAAnalyzer

analyzer = NBAAnalyzer()
scraper = OddsScraper()
odds = scraper.fetch_odds_api(sport="basketball_nba")

edges = []
for game in odds:
    edge = analyzer.analyze_game(**{**game, "injuries": []})
    if edge:
        edges.append(edge)

print(f"Found {len(edges)} edges")
```

### Example 3: Backtesting
```python
from src.backtest.engine import BacktestEngine

engine = BacktestEngine(initial_bankroll=10000)
result = engine.run_backtest(edges, outcomes)

print(f"ROI: {result.roi:.1%}")
print(f"Sharpe: {result.sharpe_ratio:.2f}")
```

## 🎲 Sports Supported
The demo ships with analyzers and team registries for:

| Sport code | Coverage source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `basketball_nba` | Full NBA team list | Gaussian scoring model with optional injury adjustments |

## ⚙️ Configuration
Edit `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Optimal Transport
ot:
  threshold: 0.15        # Minimum W distance for edge
  p_norm: 2              # Wasserstein-2
  reg: 0.01              # Sinkhorn regularization

# Edge Detection
edge:
  min_ev: 0.03           # 3% minimum EV
  min_kelly: 0.01
  max_kelly: 0.05        # Max 5% of bankroll

# Monte Carlo
simulation:
  num_paths: 10000
  confidence_interval: 0.95

# Risk Management
risk:
  max_exposure_per_game: 0.02   # 2% per game
  max_daily_exposure: 0.10      # 10% per day
  stop_loss_daily: -0.05        # Stop at 5% daily loss
```

## 📈 Outputs and metrics
Every detected edge returned by `EdgeDetector` includes:

- Expected Value (EV) computed from true win probability vs. stake
- Kelly fraction (capped) for sizing
- True probability compared to market-implied probability
- Wasserstein distance between the modeled distribution and market line

Example CLI output from the demo:
```
⚡ EDGE DETECTED
{
  "recommendation": "OVER",
  "line": 215.5,
  "expected_value": 0.048,
  "kelly_fraction": 0.02,
  "true_prob": 0.54,
  "market_prob": 0.52,
  "wasserstein_distance": 0.19
}
```

## 🔬 How It Works (Technical)
### Pipeline in this repository
1. **Generate matchups** via `OddsScraper.fetch_odds_api`, which creates synthetic lines from the team registry for the selected sport.
2. **Estimate team baselines** with `StatsFetcher`, which provides lightweight pace/offense/variance priors for each league.
3. **Simulate outcomes** using `MonteCarloSimulator` to build a Gaussian distribution of totals that can accept manual injury impacts.
4. **Measure distance** between the simulated distribution and the market line using `OTEngine.distance_between_distributions`.
5. **Detect edges** with `EdgeDetector`, which applies the EV calculator and Kelly sizing, then filters on OT distance and minimum EV thresholds.

### Extending to real data
- Replace the stubbed odds generator with an API-backed fetcher inside `src/data/odds_scraper.py`.
- Swap `StatsFetcher` internals for live stat feeds or model outputs.
- Tune thresholds in `config.yaml` to match your risk profile once real data is connected.
